Error 6:
Getting this error in Apple's terminal when writing 'npm run ios':
- error EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n0000000000000/T/metro-cache/00'.
- I thought that the cause of this error is I have deleted Caches(size- 3GB) from Xcode Build File inside Developer < Storage
- The Real problem was upgrading to MacOS sequioa 15.7 which changed the ownership of the directories causing such error, rather than fault of deleting caches file


Tried Efforts:
- sudo rm -rf /var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n0000000000000/T/metro-cache
- [
    cd ios
    rm -rf build
    pod deintegrate
    pod install
    cd ..
    npm run ios
]
- [ 
    rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
    rm -rf /tmp/metro-*
    rm -rf /tmp/react-*
    rm -rf /var/folders/*/*/*/metro-cache
]
- sudo chown -R $(whoami) /var/folders
- [
    rm -rf node_modules
    npm install
]
- [
    ls -ld /var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n0000000000000/T
    Output- drwx------  52 root  wheel  1664 Oct 29 21:14 /var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n0000000000000/T
    ChatGPT Explanation: 
    - That /var/folders/.../T directory is owned by root, not your user (architgupta).

    - So when Metro (the JS bundler) tries to cache files there, macOS blocks it — because your React Native process doesn’t have permission to write in a folder owned by root.

    - This usually happens if you ran Metro or your app once with sudo, which created those cache directories under the root account.
]
- Now Xcode Caches have however returned of completely 3GB. Also I have also downloaded Command Lines Tool update for another 2.5GB but still nothing is happening

- [
   - sudo chown -R root:architgupta /usr/local/lib/node_modules/
   (Gave error: illegal username)
   - sudo chown -R root:staff /usr/local/lib/node_modules/
   - sudo chmod -R 775 /usr/local/lib/node_modules/

    The main reason is getting permission denied during this command in Apple terminal:
    Command: ls -ld /var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n0000000000000/T/metro-cache
    Output: ls: /var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n0000000000000/T/metro-cache: Permission denied
]

Succeded Efforts:
[
    Adding this command in .zshrc file:
    export TMPDIR=$HOME/.reactnative_tmp

    What it did:
    TMPDIR(Temporary Directory) is an environment variable that tells macOS and Node.js where to store temporary files.
    By default, it points to a system-protected directory like:
    /var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n0000000000000/T/
    which caused your “EACCES: permission denied” errors.
    $HOME = your home directory (/Users/architgupta).
    It points all future React Native (and other temp operations) to a safe location:

    Here, we changed it to:
    $PWD/.metro_tmp
    $PWD = your current project folder,
    → .metro_tmp = a local subfolder we created there.
    PWD(Present Working Directory)

    So now, all temporary files (including Metro cache) are written inside your project, not the system folder.
    mkdir -p .metro_tmp
    Creates that .metro_tmp folder if it doesn’t already exist.
    -p just means “don’t complain if it already exists”.
