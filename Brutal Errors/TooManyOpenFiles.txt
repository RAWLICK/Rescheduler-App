Error 1 Display:
I ran npm run android for running my react native file and it gave error in terminal:
node:events:485
      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
      ^

Error: EMFILE: too many open files, watch
    at FSWatcher._handle.onchange (node:internal/fs/watchers:207:21)
Emitted 'error' event on NodeWatcher instance at:

Tried Efforts:
It has actually surpassed the limit to watch numerous files.
ulimit -n 8192 (Changed Limit with this command to watch files)
Add the above command in zshrc file 
sudo nano /etc/pam.d/launchd (Typed this command opening a file)
session required pam_limits.so (Added this line)
sudo nano /etc/security/limits.conf (Typed this command)
Added below lines:
*           hard    nofile          8192
*           soft    nofile          8192
Reset the cache by runnig command (U Know)
lsof | grep node | wc -l (Ran this command to check if the system is hitting the file limit)
The answer came 11 which is too low as comparison to set limit 8192.
Restart the mac
Added below code to metro.config.js (present in config part):

const {getDefaultConfig, mergeConfig} = require('@react-native/metro-config');
const exclusionList = require('metro-config/src/defaults/exclusionList');

/**
 * Metro configuration
 * https://reactnative.dev/docs/metro
 *
 * @type {import('metro-config').MetroConfig}
 */
const config = {
  resolver: {
    // Exclude certain paths or unnecessary files from being watched
    blacklistRE: exclusionList([
      /node_modules\/.*\/node_modules\/.*/, // Prevent nested `node_modules` from being watched
    ]),
  },
  watchFolders: [
    './src', // Explicitly watch only the `src` directory (or your app code directory)
  ],
};

module.exports = mergeConfig(getDefaultConfig(__dirname), config);

ulimit -n (Ran this command to check the limit which I had set [It was 8192])

Installed nvm and performed these commands to add lines in zshrc file:
brew install nvm
mkdir ~/.nvm
echo "export NVM_DIR=\"$HOME/.nvm\"" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "[ -s \"/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh\" ] && . \"/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh\"" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

Then installed nvm 20 but couldn't use it because of some error:
nvm install 20
nvm use 20

Upgraded watchman:
brew upgrade watchman

Then this command and it made a change first time(but showing an error at the start):
watchman watch-del-all

Succedded Effort:
watchman watch-del-all
