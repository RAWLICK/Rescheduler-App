Gradle is just like a contractor of the house you are building.
• Materials (dependencies like libraries)
• Blueprints (source code)
• Construction tools (compilers, SDKs)
• A contractor who knows how to put it all together.
That contractor = Gradle.
Gradle turns the code into APK file in simple language, that too with an automated process.

Gradle is only for android which requires Android Studio. For iOS it's xcodebuild which requires XCode.

settings.Gradle -
Think of it like the attendance sheet for your app’s modules. It tells Gradle:
👉 “Hey! These are the parts of the project I want to include when I build the app.”
Without it, Android wouldn’t know what to compile together.

MainActivity.java- 🚪
- It is like entry gate of your Android app 🚪.
- This is the first screen that launches when your React Native Android app starts.
- Defines the name of the JS module to render (usually App or whatever you registered).
- Now React Native generates both MainActivity and MainActivity in .kt(Kotlin) format from new version becasue Kotlin is  Officially recommended by Google for Android development.

MainActivity.java- 🧠
- It is like heart of my react native app 🧠.
- This is the central control center that sets up your React Native app on Android.
- Initializes React Native
- Loads native modules (like maps, camera, Firebase, etc.)
- Sets up debug tools like Flipper
- For iOS it's (AppDelegate.mm)
- Now React Native generates both MainActivity and MainActivity in .kt(Kotlin) format from new version becasue Kotlin is  Officially recommended by Google for Android development.

React-RuntimeHermes: 🛢
- Normally, React Native apps run JavaScript using Apple’s JavaScriptCore (JSC).
- Hermes is a faster, smaller alternative made by Meta (Facebook) just for React Native.
- React-RuntimeHermes is the code that connects React Native to Hermes so your app uses Hermes instead of JSC.
- Imagine your app is a car, and JavaScript is the engine fuel.
  JSC is the standard fuel, but Hermes is a faster and more efficient fuel.
  React-RuntimeHermes is the part of the car that makes it possible to run on Hermes fuel.
