Gradle is just like a contractor of the house you are building.
• Materials (dependencies like libraries)
• Blueprints (source code)
• Construction tools (compilers, SDKs)
• A contractor who knows how to put it all together.
That contractor = Gradle.
Gradle turns the code into APK file in simple language, that too with an automated process.

Gradle is only for android which requires Android Studio. For iOS it's xcodebuild which requires XCode.

settings.Gradle -
Think of it like the attendance sheet for your app’s modules. It tells Gradle:

- It is like heart of my react native app 🧠.
- This is the central control center that sets up your React Native app on Android.
- Initializes React Native
- Loads native modules (like maps, camera, Firebase, etc.)
- Sets up debug tools like Flipper
- For iOS it's (AppDelegate.mm)
