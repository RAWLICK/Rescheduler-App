Error2 Problem:
We are trying to run ->
console.log("ScheduleArray: ", ScheduleArray)
but nothing is getting displayed, not even the string part but if I remove the ScheduleArray element then the strings will start getting displayed.
The same problem happens with displaying "data" which contains same values.
What it is known as "silent quitting" of console.log

Tried Efforts:
Optional chaining:
console.log("ScheduleArray (In Schedule.tsx): ", ScheduleArray ?? 'Not Available');

Conditional Logging:
if (ScheduleArray) {
  console.log("ScheduleArray (In Schedule.tsx): ", ScheduleArray);
} else {
  console.log("ScheduleArray is undefined or empty.");
}


Succedded Effort:
