Error 5:
Failed to build iOS project. "xcodebuild" exited with error code '65'. To debug build logs furthur, consider building your app with xcode app by opening Rescheduler.xcworkspace.

Whole Process:
- First we got 5 types of error in xcode.
-> Unable to open base configuration reference file.....
-> Unable to load contents of file list.....(4 times)

- This happend because the "Target Support Files" present inside Pods Folder are completely empty.
- Did pod install --repo update
- Got Error: Cocoapods could not find compatible versions for pod "React-RuntimeHermes"
- They were also accompanied with empty "Target Support Files" folder.
- Changed the deployment target to iOS 15 inplace of iOS 13 in xcode.
- Then did pod install and a lot of dependencies got installed.
- Then got error while installing hermes-engine but redoing pod install worked. Network will play a vital role in it.
- Then got Error: React-RCTAppDelegate error with 71 issues in xcode.
- Removed all packages and dependencies of 'firebase' from both ios and android 
- Removed 'use_modular_headers!' from Podfile because it was necessary to make firebase run, even when it was causing breaking issues especially in iOS 16/17.
- Erros got resolved (For more info, visit screenshot of 1 May, 2025)

Extras:
Maybe to run firebase, you need: USE_FRAMEWORKS=static bundle exec pod install
